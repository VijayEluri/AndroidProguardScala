BUILDING

* Get a copy of the Eclipse PDE - Plugin Development Environment version.

  As of 29 June 2010, that's found at:

    http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index_project.php

USE

* Create a proguard.config file containing all the options you want to pass to proguard.
* Confirm that the file works by using it from the command line:

  java -jar lib/proguard.jar @proguard.config

* Add the AndroidProguardScala builder to the dropins directory of your eclipse installation.

* Restart Eclipse and add the AndroidProguardScala nature to the desired project.

* I use seperate projects, one for my Scala code, and one project that just contains this builder.
  The project that just contains the builder depends on the projects that contain the Scala code.  When 
  anything in those projects changes, the builder is invoked and starts Proguard.

  Once the build is finished, the builder refreshes its own project.  Presumably proguard will write to files
  in that project, and the refresh will allow Eclipse to pick up those changes.

  Notice that the builder is almost entirely ignorant.  It sees that things it depends on have changed.  It
  then calls proguard.  Proguard gets everything it needs from the proguard.config file.  The builder
  gives it zero extra information.

DIAGNOSING PROBLEMS

* Build from the command line.  There shouldn't be any significant difference between how the builder
  uses proguard and what you do from the command line.

  The builder definitely needs improvement here.

SILLY BUILDER TRICKS

* There's no simple way that I saw to get progress information from proguard, so I just replace STDOUT and
  report the number of bytes written.  It's a hack, but seems to be working well enough.  Patches 
  welcome :-).

WHY NOT JUST SHELL OUT?

* I couldn't figure out how to get Eclipse to recognize that proguard had created new files, so I'd keep
  making changes that didn't get to the final product.

* It feels faster.  It's not starting up a new jvm every time, for one.

* It can be interupted.  The shell locks things up for quite a bit of time.
